SYNOPSIS

INTRODUCTION
The aim of this project is to deliver an application that runs in the android environment and supported by a web app for certain components as well. It will serve as a centralized hub or “one-stop shop” for various college related activities. The app will follow material design guidelines and use the android notification channels to notify the users about various alerts related to their educational institution. 
The main technology used will be obviously Android Studio 3.0. Since the app is meant to run within the android environment, we must use the studio to develop the app. Knowledge of xml to design the UI and JAVA to write the logic is important. Hence, an editor like Notepad++ and Sublime text for writing code is also used. Both software handles multiple languages very well. Sublime Text is excellent at auto completion and will be of massive help. 
The major functionality of the project involves the use of notifications. These notifications are to be centralized. They must be sent from server to everyone using the app via a network. This is a problem that must be tackled by us using a notification server like Google Cloud Messaging or a Firebase Server.

MOTIVATION
We as students encounter the very problem we are trying to solve every day. It is a norm to join certain google groups meant for the class each semester. This might seem centralized but it is rather very fragmented. There exist many WhatsApp groups for certain subjects as well. However, most electronic material seems to be delivered as PDFs to students via email. The google groups also generate another email. There is the added factor of course websites which sometimes can be incomplete, and other times – completely inaccessible. All in all, the entire situation to students and teachers seem cluttered.   
The students take additional measures to organize the material that they receive with custom inbox labels, separate documents to counter act the cluttered nature of the situation and so on. While others waste valuable time trying to find the right document to study at the wrong time. The entire ordeal seems like a problem that is easy to solve but not yet solved. This enabled us to take on this project to present a solution to this cluttered situation saving time and energy to both students and teachers.  
As mentioned, the very motivation we seek to do this project arises from our own day to day solution. This seems like the best place to actually find motivation to do take on a project rather than actively searching for it. By doing this project, we are primarily helping to improve our own lives, if not by a small amount. We hope that the solution provided will be a breakthrough for students everywhere that deal with this problem. With the advent and growth of electronic media and internet, the problem will only grow with time. Reducing the need to do our own work by automating it with another service is the first step towards optimizing our work flow.
